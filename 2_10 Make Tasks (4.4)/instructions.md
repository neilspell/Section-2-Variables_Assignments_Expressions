# 4.4 Make Task

## What's a 'Make' Task?

In these tasks you have to use the skills learned in the previous exercises to create a new program based on the requirements below.

## Task 1 - Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle in ``main.py``

- Get input for height & width. Convert to integers and store in variables
````python 
height = input("Enter height: ")
width = 
````

- Calculate the area & store the result in the area variable
  ````python
  # Area of a Rectangle is Length x Width
  area = 
  ````

- Output the area variable (converted to string)
````python
print()
````

## Too Easy?  Try these:

### Task 2 - Perimeter Calculation
Create a program that allows the user to enter 2 numbers representing the width and length of a rectangle. The program calculates and displays the perimeter of the rectangle.

````python
length = int(input("Enter value for length: ")) 
width = 
````

### Task 3 - Restaurant Tip Calculator 
Create a program that allows the user to enter the price of a meal at a restaurant. The program calculates the amount of the tip to be paid at 20%. The tip and total price are then displayed separately.

````python
# how to calculate tip amount
price = 
tipAmount = price * .2 
totalPrice = 

````

### Task 4 - Volume and Surface Area
Create a program that allows the user to enter 3 numbers representing the height, width and length of a cuboid. The program calculates and displays the volume and total surface area of the cuboid. 

- *Extra Credit: Add in the correct units of meaurement at the end of your answer.*

````python 
volume = 
surfaceArea = 2 * ((length * height) + (width * height) + (length * width))


````
